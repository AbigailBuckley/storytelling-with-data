# Storytelling with Data

This repository contains course materials for the Dartmouth Course [Story Telling with Data (PSYC 81.06)](http://pbs.dartmouth.edu/undergraduate/permission-courses/fall-2017).  The syllabus may be found [[here](https://github.com/ContextLab/storytelling-with-data/blob/master/PSYC_81_syllabus.pdf)].

## Student instructions

If you are a student enrolled in the class (or if you'd like to following along!) run through this [GitHub tutorial](https://try.github.io) before doing anything else.  Then fork this repository so that you can contribute!

You should also sign up for the course's [Slack account](stories-about-data.slack.com) (you need to join using your @dartmouth.edu email address).

All code for this course should be written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and organized in a [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/).  Any data you analyze must be shareable with all other students in the course, and ideally it should be shareable with the public.  All code and other student-generated materials will be shared publically.

## Tutorials

In addition to the GitHub tutorial above, if you're new to computer programming, Python, or Jupyter notebooks, you'll want to run through some tutorials to help you get started.

- Introduction to [Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) (beginner)
- Introduction to [Git](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) (beginner)
- Video introduction to [Jupyter Notebooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9cSF3eVQv0) (with [code](https://github.com/alfredessa/awesomedata.science/tree/master/1.0JupyterTour)) (beginner)

Once you have the basics down, you can move on to learn about some very useful Python packages:

- Introduction to [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html) (intermediate)
- Practice your Pandas [skills](https://github.com/guipsamora/pandas_exercises) (intermediate)
- Getting started with [Numpy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/quickstart.html) (intermediate)
- Getting started with [Scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/index.html) (intermediate)
- Exploring high dimensional data with [HyperTools](http://blog.kaggle.com/2017/04/10/exploring-the-structure-of-high-dimensional-data-with-hypertools-in-kaggle-kernels/) (intermediate)
