# Storytelling with Data

This repository contains course materials for the Dartmouth Course [Story Telling with Data (PSYC 81.06)](http://pbs.dartmouth.edu/undergraduate/permission-courses/fall-2017).

## Student instructions

If you are a student enrolled in the class (or if you'd like to following along!) run through this [GitHub tutorial](https://try.github.io) before doing anything else.  Then fork this repository so that you can contribute!

You should also sign up for the course's [Slack account](stories-about-data.slack.com) (you need to join using your @dartmouth.edu email address).

All code for this course should be written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and organized in a [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/).  Any data you analyze must be shareable with all other students in the course, and ideally it should be shareable with the public.  All code and other student-generated materials will be shared publically.
