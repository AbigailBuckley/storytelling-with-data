# Storytelling with Data: Assignment 1

- Learn about GitHub and Python coding basics

Goals:
- fork github repo
- create a new "data story" by creating a new folder
- add a readme file
- create a jupyter notebook that (at minimum) makes use of each of the following:
  - imports one or more libraries
  - defines a function
  - uses an if/elif/else block
  - uses a for loop
  - uses a while loop
  - uses a list
  - documents where you satisfied each of these requirements using "markdown" cells in the notebook
  - reads in some data (e.g. a text file, website, csv file, etc.)
    - any data files must be included in your "story" folder
  - prints out something related to the data (e.g. some part of the content of the file)
  - does a "analysis" (can be a trivial one) of the data and prints a statement with the result
- create a pull request to submit the assignment to the main repo

Honor code:
- do not look at other people's solutions until you've submitted your pull request
