# Storytelling with Data: Assignment 3

- Learn about data visualization

Goals:
- create a new "data story" by creating a new folder OR modify an existing folder
- add a readme file (or update an existing one)
- create a NEW jupyter notebook that (at minimum) does each of the following:
  - loads the data into a Pandas dataframe or Numpy array
  - uses seaborn to create:
    - a barplot
    - a scatterplot
    - a line plot
    - a heatmap
    - another neat-looking visualation of your choosing
- uses hypertools to:
 - plot your data as a 3D trajectory using at least 3 different dimensionality reduction algorithms
 - plot some text data as a 3D trajectory
- include markdown comments to describe what you did and what you "found""
- create a pull request to submit the assignment to the main repo
