# Storytelling with Data: Assignment 1

## Overview
The purpose of this assignment is to introduce you to GitHub and basic programming in Python.  In this assignment you will perform some basic GitHub operations and write a computer program.  Completing the assignment entails finishing *all* of the tasks below.  To receive credit for this assignment you must submit it by making a pull request to the [main course GitHub repository](https://github.com/ContextLab/storytelling-with-data) by the due date (prior to the start of class on Friday, March 29, 2019).  This assignment is worth 3% of your final course grade.

## A note on what it means to "complete" this assignment
You may not be able to complete every part of this assignment.  That's OK!  If you are stuck on any step or task, you can still earn most of the credit (up to 90%) if you do the following for each thing you got stuck on, written in one or more `Markdown` cell(s) within your assignment's Jupyter notebook:
1. Describe (in plain English) what you were trying to do
2. Describe how you tried to solve the task
3. Describe what you thought would happen when you tried solving the task in that way
4. Describe what actually happened
5. Describe what you did to help get yourself unstuck (e.g. asked a classmate, met with the course instructor, posted questions to Slack, searched on Google or Stack Exchange, read a book, watched a tutorial, etc.)
6. Estimate how much time you spent working on that part of the assignment (rounded to the nearest hour)

## Setup task list
Work through the setup instructions in the [course introduction README file](https://github.com/ContextLab/storytelling-with-data/blob/master/README.md):
  - [ ] Create a fork of this GitHub repository
  - [ ] Create an account on the course JupyterHub cluster
  - [ ] Create a personal folder for your use under the Psych81.09/course directory on DartFS (name it something unique, using your first name, last name, username, or some combination)
  - [ ] Clone your fork of the course GitHub repository to your personal folder

Next, create your assignment file:
  - [ ] Navigate to the `storytelling-with-data/assignments/assignment 1/submissions` folder and create a new Jupyter notebook (select the `Psych 81.09` kernel from the dropdown menu in the upper right).  Rename the notebook to `<lastname>_<firstname>.ipynb` (you don't need to specify the file extension if you rename it from within the Jupyter window).

## What to add to your notebook
You'll be adding some simple sample code to your notebook to get familiar with the main tools (Python, Jupyter notebooks, GitHub) that we'll be using throughout this course.  If this is your first time working with Jupyter notebooks, you may want to check out [this tutorial](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/format/slides/github/dartmouth-brainhack-2017/IntroToJupyter/blob/master/Intro_To_Jupyter_Notebooks.ipynb#/) (you may also want to view the [associated video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSkTJRNBTME&index=3&t=0s&list=PLEE6ggCEJ0H0KOlMKx_PUVB_16VoCfGj9)).  Similarly, if you haven't written computer code before, you'll likely want to go through a Python tutorial like [this one](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python).  You don't need to go through the full tutorial to complete this assignment-- just go through as much as you need to in order to accomplish the tasks below.

In your notebook, please do each of the following:
- [ ] Create a cell at the top of your notebook that imports one or more libraries (e.g. `numpy`, `pandas`, etc.)
- [ ] Create another cell that defines a Python function (it can do anything).  The function should:
  - [ ] Support one or more input arguments
  - [ ] Use an `if`/`elif`/`else` block somewhere in the function
  - [ ] Use a `for` loop somewhere in the function
  - [ ] Use a `while` loop somewhere in the function
  - [ ] Use a `list` somewhere in the function
  - [ ] Return one or more values
- [ ] Add a third cell that runs your function on some sample input and prints the result
- [ ] Add a `Markdown` cell (above the cell that defines your function) that describes what the function does.  ([Here](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) is a quick introduction to Markdown.)  Include, in plain-English, information about:
  - [ ] What arguments the user needs to pass to the function
  - [ ] What values are supported
  - [ ] What the function does
  - [ ] What gets returned

## Advanced users
If you are already familiar with Python, as a challenge problem for this assignment (for fun) take a look at one of the projects in the `data-stories` folder and modify it in some way.  (This should be done in addition to the above assignment.)

## Submitting your assignment
Your assignment is considered to have been submitted when you make a pull request to the main course GitHub repository.

## Honor code
You may work with other students on this project, but you may *not* copy anyone else's code.  Each student should independently code up and submit their own work.  If you work with other students on this assignment you should make a note (in a Markdown comment) in your Jupyter notebook.
