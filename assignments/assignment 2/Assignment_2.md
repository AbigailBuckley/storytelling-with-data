# Storytelling with Data: Assignment 2

- Learn about datasets and data wrangling with Numpy and Pandas

Goals:
- create a new "data story" by creating a new folder
- add a readme file
- find and download a (small) dataset and add it to the folder
- create a jupyter notebook that (at minimum) makes use of each of the following:
  - loads the data into a Pandas dataframe
  - do some basic cleaning:
    - remove non-numerical values
    - use fill_na to remove "nan" values
    - rename or drop rows/columns that are irrelevant
- use "apply" to add a new column
- use the "group by" function to create a summary table
- create a plot
- extract the data from the dataframe as a numpy array
- do a basic analysis or data visualization (e.g. compute a summary of the data, plot a heatmap or barplot, etc.)
- include markdown comments to describe what you did and what you "found""
- create a pull request to submit the assignment to the main repo
