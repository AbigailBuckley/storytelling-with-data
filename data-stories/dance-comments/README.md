# Overview

My project is analyzing the types of words used when people comment on the dances of different genres. I am going to see if there are patterns in the types of words used depending on the genre, For example, are there certain words used when commenting on a ballet video and are there certain words used when commenting on a hip hop video? What is the sentiment of the comments? Can I determine what genre of dance is in the video just based on the comments? 

I will be focusing on [Millenium Dance Complex](http://millenniumdancecomplex.com) and the [American Ballet Theatre](http://abt.org). 

I will be using [Youtube](http://youtube.com) and [Instagram](http://instagram.com) to collect comments.

I will begin by creating a word cloud to find patterns in word usage. There will be a map detailing my findings.
