# Overview

My project was about human resources analytics. I used a dataset from Kaggle that wanted someone to solve the problem of employee retention. I created different plots to assess which factors contributed most to employee turnover.

# Downloading the dataset

The following dataset provides the data associated with each variable recorded. Each data point corresponds to each employee.

# Running the code

Describe, in sufficient detail for a new person (moderately competent but unfamiliar with your work) to follow, how to run your code.

First you want to download the dataset to your Jupyter notebook. I used Collaboratory because my PC was not opening up the Jupyter notebook in my web browser. Organize the data so you can see each variable. From there you will need to import different tools, such as hypertools and seaborn, in order to start creating plots. Then from there you can start creates different plots using some of the code I used in my notebook. Most of the variables were numeric so plotting them was easy. There were a couple that I had to change in order to plot. In order to do that you simply change the categorical variable, salary, to a numeric form. This will help when you are comparing different variables to see their effect on employee retention.

# Contributing to the code

I would suggest doing a regression and possibly a t-test to see if there is a significant correlation between the different variables. This would help support or possibly refute the claims I made from the code I already created.
