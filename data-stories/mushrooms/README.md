# Overview

This project is intended to demonstrate some basic ways to load in data and plot it (using hypertools).  The project is based (heavily!) off of a sample notebook from [this repository](https://github.com/ContextLab/hypertools-paper-notebooks).

# Downloading the dataset

We'll be using a Mushroom Classification dataset from Kaggle.  The data is included in this repository, or it may be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification)

# Running the code

All code for the project is included in the Jupyter notebook (mushrooms.ipynb) in this folder.

# Contributing to the code
