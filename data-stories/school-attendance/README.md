# Overview

We'll be exploring student attendance data from local schools.  Local police and school administrators are interested in understanding the patterns that contribute to truancy.

# Downloading the dataset

The data is not yet public but is taken from a spreadsheet including students' demographic and attendance info

# Running the code

Each major analysis (or set of analyses) should be organized in a Jupyter notebook.

# Contributing to the code

We'll be keeping track of ideas and project tasks using [Trello](www.trello.com).  To join the project board, use [this link](https://trello.com/invite/b/0MwxqRPI/4647c6aaa1523576cf97c715864f88c0/school-attendance-project).

To contribute an analysis (individually or as a small team):
- Fork this repository and give any team members access (also give Jeremy and Andy admin access, via Settings)
- Describe what you want to do on the Trello board (e.g. add a new card under the "To do") column
- Create a new Jupyter notebook (either from scratch, or using another notebook as a template) and name it something related to your analysis
- When you have something to share, submit a pull request and announce your progress via the [`#school-attendance`](https://stories-about-data.slack.com/messages/C751WC211/) channel on Slack
